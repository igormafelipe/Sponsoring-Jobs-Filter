OVERVIEW: This is a program to fetch from a list of companies in a .xlsx file,
and look for current job postings from these companies. The program allows you to filter based on some creteria explained in USAGE.

PURPOSE: Looking for job opportunities abroad can be challenging, and finding
companies that actually sponsor can be even harder. It is common for Linkedin
applications and other websites to label a job as "May Sponsor", just to later
on find that they in fact do not sponsor for that position.

are able to sponsor for a Worker's Visa. Based on this list, this program is 
able to then filter for current job posting from these acredited companies.
